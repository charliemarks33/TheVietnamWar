  <h1>The War That Never Ended</h1>
  <p>The Vietnam War (1955–1975) was a prolonged and divisive conflict in Southeast Asia. Fought between communist North Vietnam (and its Viet Cong insurgents in the South) and anti-communist South Vietnam (backed by the United States), the war became a devastating Cold War battleground. Over 3 million people, including more than 58,000 Americans, lost their lives in the Vietnam War. More than half of those killed were Vietnamese civilians, underscoring the immense human cost of the war. Decades later, its impact still “lives on” in veterans, families, and a nation grappling with its lessons.</p>
